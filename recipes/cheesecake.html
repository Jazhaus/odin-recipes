    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Crust</li>
                <ul>
                   <li>1 1/2 cups (150g) graham cracker crumbs (about 10 whole graham crackers, crushed)</li> 
                    <li>1/4 cup (28g) confectioners' sugar</li> 
                    <li>6 tablespoons (85g) butter, melted</li> 
                    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li> 
                </ul>
            <li>Filling</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>two 8-ounce packages (452g) cream cheese, at room temperature</li> 
                    <li>2/3 cup (133g) granulated sugar</li> 
                    <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li> 
                    <li>1 teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract</li> 
                </ul>
        </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.</li>       
            <li>To make the crust: Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.</li>
            <li>To make the filling: Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</li>
